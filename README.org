#+title: rg theme collection

This is a collection of all the Emacs themes I have created.

https://gligan.net/emacs-themes

** Installation

With Emacs 30 or higher, you can directly pull the files from this
repository:

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package rg-themes
  :vc (:url "https://github.com/raegnald/rg-themes"
       :branch "main"))
#+end_src

Otherwise, just clone this repo into your Emacs folder.

** Usage

Select a theme to apply by using the =rg-themes-set= function. You can
call this function interactively. Find the theme you like most, and
then to load it automatically every time you open Emacs, add it to
your Emacs configuration.

Let's say that you liked the Ellas theme, then you would add:

#+begin_src elisp
(rg-themes-set 'ellas)
#+end_src

Note that the function =rg-themes-set= can work with any theme -- even
themes that are not part of this collection. Use this function if you
want other functionality of this package to work, like
=rg-themes-spacious-frame= for instance.
